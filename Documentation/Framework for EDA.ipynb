    "The absentism dataset gives the information of the employee Identification who are absent for various reasons and their time of absence in hours in a specific month which is spread across multiple days of the week. The dataset provides additional information such as each individual employee driving distance from home to work and their associated transportation expense. Also, gives the personal information of individual employee's  such as their age, education,lifestye(drinking,smoking behaviors, no of children, no of pets), how long each of them have been in service and obesity(height,weight,BMI). This dataset also says if the emplyoee had a disciplinary failure action.\n",
